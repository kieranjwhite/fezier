* Find vertex with greatest normal dim diff and select the complementary vertex as partner
** Alg
*** given verts[0]...verts[3]
*** if on_x compare x_coords
**** verts[0].x and verts[2].x
**** verts[1].x and verts[2].x
**** verts[0].x and verts[3].x
**** verts[1].x and verts[3].x
**** let the largest diff be from verts[i].x to verts[j].x
**** an edge will exist between verts[1-i] and verts[j] and between verts[i] and verts[2+(3-j)]
*** if !on_x compare y_coords
**** verts[0].y and verts[2].y
**** verts[1].y and verts[2].y
**** verts[0].y and verts[3].y
**** verts[1].y and verts[3].y
**** let the largest diff be from verts[i].y to verts[j].y
**** an edge will exist between verts[1-i] and verts[j] and between verts[i] and verts[2+(3-j)]
** Criticism
*** Fails for case (8) in quadrant_vertices.svg
